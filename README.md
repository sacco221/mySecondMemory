# About the app, My Second memory

Have you ever experienced this at a supermarket or grocery store?

- I came shopping but I don't know what's in the fridge right now...
- I think it's in stock, but I don't remember. .. ..
- I can't remember which product I use all the time!

If yes„ÄÅthis app may be able to help you.
If you register the items you have at home, this app will remember your inventory on your behalf and you can check what you have on the go.
